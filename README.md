# Problem statement

XYZ wants to build an online movie ticket booking platform that caters to both B2B (theatre partners) and B2C (end
customers) clients.

Key goals it wants accomplished as part of its solution:

- Enable theatre partners to onboard their theatres over this platform and get access to a bigger customer base while
  going digital.
- Enable end customers to browse the platform to get access to movies across different cities, languages, and genres, as
  well as book tickets in advance with a seamless experience.
